"""## Overview

This document explains how to integrate with the Prometheus charm
for the purposes of providing a metrics endpoint to Prometheus. It
also explains how alternative implementations of the Prometheus charm
may maintain the same interface and be backward compatible with all
currently integrated charms. Finally this document is the
authoritative reference on the structure of relation data that is
shared between Prometheus charms and any other charm that intends to
provide a scrape target for Prometheus.

## Consumer Library Usage

This Prometheus charm interacts with its scrape targets using this
charm library This charm library is constructed using the [Provider
and Consumer](https://ops.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#module-ops.relation)
objects from the Operator Framework. This implies charms that would
like to expose metric endpoints for the Prometheus charm must use the
`PrometheusConsumer` object from the charm library to do so. Using the
`PrometheusConsumer` object requires instantiating it, typically in
the constructor of your charm (the one which exposes the metrics
endpoint). The `PrometheusConsumer` constructor requires the name of
the relation over which a scrape target (metrics endpoint) is exposed
to the Promtheus charm. This relation must use the `prometheus_scrape`
interface. In addition the constructor also requires a `consumes`
specification, which is a dictionary with key `prometheus` (also see
Provider Library Usage below) and a value that represents the minimum
acceptable version of Prometheus. This version string can be in any
format that is compatible with Python [Semantic Version
module](https://pypi.org/project/semantic-version/).  For example,
assuming your charm exposes a metrics endpoint over a relation named
"monitoring", you may instantiate `PrometheusConsumer` as follows

    from charms.prometheus_k8s.v0.prometheus import PrometheusConsumer

    def __init__(self, *args):
        super().__init__(*args)
        ...
        self.prometheus = PrometheusConsumer(self, "monitoring", {"prometheus": ">=2.0"})
        ...

This example hard codes the consumes dictionary argument containing the
minimal Prometheus version required, however you may want to consider
generating this dictionary by some other means, such as a
`self.consumes` property in your charm. This is because the minimum
required Prometheus version may change when you upgrade your charm. Of
course it is expected that you will keep this version string updated
as you develop newer releases of you charm. If the version string can
be determined at run time by inspecting the actual deployed version of
your charmed application, this would be ideal.

An instantiated `PrometheusConsumer` object may be used to add
or remove Prometheus scrape targets.  Adding and removing scrape
targets may be done using the `add_endpoint()` and `remove_endpoint()`
methods. Both these methods require the host address (usually IP) of
the scrape target, but optionally also accept a port (default 80) on
which the metrics endpoint is exposed. At present it is assumed that
the metrics endpoint will be exposed with a URL path `/metrics` at the
specified host and port. This is the default behaviour of Prometheus
that most compatible metrics exporters confirm to. As an example to
add a metrics endpoint using the instantiated `PrometheusConsumer`
object in your charms `StartEvent` handler you may do

    def _on_start(self, event):
        self.prometheus.add_endpoint(my_ip)

There is no reason that metrics endpoint need to be added in the start
event handler. This may be done in any event handler or even the charm
constructor. However this does require that the host address is known
at that point in time. Both the `add_endpoint()` and
`remove_endpoint()` methods are idempotent and invoking them multiple
times with the same host address and port has no adverse effect, no
events generated. `PrometheusConsumer` object caches lists of unique
scrape targets, indexed in its stored state. Both the methods exchange
information with Prometheus charm application relation data. Hence
both of these methods trigger `RelationChangedEvents` for the
Prometheus charm when new scrape targets are added or old ones
removed.

## Provider Library Usage

The `PrometheusProvider` object may be used by Prometheus
charms to manage relations with their scrape targets. For this
purposes a Prometheus charm needs to do two things

1. Instantiate the `PrometheusProvider` object providing it
with three key pieces of information

- Name of the relation that the Prometheus charm uses to interact with
  scrape targets. This relation must confirm to the
  `prometheus_scrape` interface.

- A service name. Although this is an arbitrary string, it must be the
  same string that scrape targets will use as the key of their
  `consumes` specification. Hence by convention it is recommended that
  this key be `prometheus`.

- The Prometheus application version. Since a system administrator may
  choose to deploy the Prometheus charm with a non default version of
  Prometheus, it is strongly recommended that the version string be
  determined by actually querying the running instances of
  Prometheus.

For example a Prometheus charm may instantiate the
`PrometheusProvider` in its constructor as follows

    from charms.prometheus_k8s.v0.prometheus import PrometheusProvider

    def __init__(self, *args):
        super().__init__(*args)
        ...
        self.prometheus_provider = PrometheusProvider(
                self, "monitoring", "prometheus", self.version
            )
        ...

2. A Prometheus charm also needs to respond to the
`TargetsChanged` event of the `PrometheusProvider` by adding itself as
and observer for these events, as in

    self.framework.observe(
        self.prometheus_provider.on.targets_changed,
        self._on_scrape_targets_changed,
    )

In responding to the `TargetsChanged` event the Prometheus
charm must update the Prometheus configuration so that any new scrape
targets are added and/or old ones removed from the list of scraped
endpoints. For this purpose the `PrometheusProvider` object
exposes a `jobs()` method that returns a list of scrape jobs. Each
element of this list is the Prometheus scrape configuration for that
job. In order to update the Prometheus configuration, the Prometheus
charm needs to replace the current list of jobs with the list provided
by `jobs()` as follows

    def _on_scrape_targets_changed(self, event):
        ...
        scrape_jobs = self.prometheus_provider.jobs()
        for job in scrape_jobs:
            prometheus_scrape_config.append(job)
        ...

## Relation Data

The Prometheus charm uses application relation data to obtain its list
of scrape targets. This relation data is in JSON format and it closely
resembles the YAML structure of Prometheus [scrape configuration]
(https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config).
